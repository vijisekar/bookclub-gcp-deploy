## 📘 DevOps Journey Notes

- ✅ Created `bookclub-image` using Docker
- ✅ Setup **Jenkins pipeline** to:
    - Build Docker image
    - Tag & Push to ECR
    - Deploy updated image to EKS pods
- ✅ Kubernetes files:
    - `k8s/deployment.yaml` – deploy app to pods
    - `k8s/service.yaml` – expose via LoadBalancer
- ✅ Configured IAM Roles and `aws-auth` for Jenkins access to EKS

> 💡 Now, every push to `main` triggers a Jenkins build → Docker push to ECR → Auto-deploys to EKS!
